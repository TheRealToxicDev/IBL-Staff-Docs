Any and All Bots added to our list are run through a series of tests
to ensure the bot works as expected, has a clear and obvious point of entry
and follows all of our and discords rules and regulations.

## Approval Rules
1. Bots should be added to our Main Server prior to being Approved to avoid
any issues and/or errors with the process and our website.

2. You should follow the [Queue](https://infinitybotlist.com/queue) and positions
when approving or denying bots. (ie: they should be tested in the order they were added.)

3. **DO NOT** Mass Ping our Devs or Owners you will notice in our testing server
our Server Owners have Alt Accounts who are constantly offline. These accounts are
here for you to test the commands and functions of the bots!

4. Please be precise when adding a reason for Approval, Tell the owner why their bot was
approved (Everything works amazing) as well as a list of things you recommend them changing etc
